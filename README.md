    - configuration-1/01-md-sal.xml to configuration/initial
    - configuration-1/*.conf to configuration/initial
    - configuration-1/myrun.sh to .
8. Zip up the openflowplugin distribution and copy it on to all nodes where you intend to run opendaylight

    - Edit myrun.sh and change the name of the member. Note that configuration1 requires atleast two members to function.
    - Edit application.conf to have the right host_names. Note that the seed node hostname should be the same for all members
